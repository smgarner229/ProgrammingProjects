TODOS:

-> Make a consistent naming scheme for struct type, storage type, and operation type of angles
-> Separate print to make cleaner (potentially move macro to cpp?)
-> Cleanup Print statements to make output more clean
-> Make helper functions to loop over atoms for calculations
    -> Pseudocode:
        call_loop_structure(molecule_to_loop_through,function_to_apply,location_to_store_data)
